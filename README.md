A. Flipping a Coin in Quantum:

It is the most basic problem to understand the randomness of quantum computer .

By flipping a coin and measuring it we will always get only one outcome heads or tails.
Under which the majority one wins.

To create a simple circuit that does a Quantum flip. You need following :
1. Initialize a Qubit
2. Initialize a classical bit (used for measurement)
3. Create a circuit to act on them by using Hadamard gate (for superposition)
4. Initialize a counter to keep track.

** Hadamard gates puts a quibit in superpostion resulting into two possible outcomes 0 or 1 which is perfectly suited for a coin toss.


B. Roll a dice with 8 sides

To create a simple circuit that does a Dice roll 8 sides. You need following :
1. Initialize 3 Quantum register
2. Initialize 3 classical bit (used for measurement)
3. Put all the quantum registers in superposition statesusing Hadamard gate.
4. Logic here is of allocation 2^3 = 8 combination with respect to 000 as 1 and 001 as 2 and so on.
