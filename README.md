Flipping a Coin :

It is the most basic problem to understand the randomness of quantum computer .

By flipping a coin and measuring it we will always get only one outcome heads or tails.
Under which the majority one wins.

To create a simple circuit that does a Quantum flip. You need following :
1. Initialize a Qubit
2. initialize a classical bit (used for measurement)
3. Create a circuit to act on them by using Hadamard gate (for superposition)
4. Initialize a counter to keep track.

** Hadamard gates puts a quibit in superpostion resulting into two possible outcomes 0 or 1 which is perfectly suited for a coin toss.
